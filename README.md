# Glitch
A grid-based movement system for an Android game built with Unity in C#.
The player’s swipes should control the avatar’s direction.
the width and height of the grid is be able to be configured within the inspector, so that the density of the movement grid can be dynamically changed.
Used asset bundles to load some assets in the game from the server.
